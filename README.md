# mtk-imei-switcheroo

Read and write IMEI(s) in the NVRAM `LD0B_001` file on **DuoQin F21 Pro** (single-SIM), **DuoQin F25** (dual-SIM), and **TIQ M5** (dual-SIM, MT6761) — or in a full `nvdata` partition image — offline, no device needed.

> `live_patch.sh` is an interactive ADB script that patches a live rooted MTK device. On dual-SIM devices it prompts for slot 1 or 2 — see [Live device patching](#live-device-patching).

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alltechdev/mtk-imei-switcheroo
cd mtk-imei-switcheroo
pip install pycryptodome    # only needed for the IMEI tools (imei_tool.py / live_patch.sh)
```

Then run `./live_patch.sh` for the interactive IMEI flow, or call `python3 imei_tool.py` directly. The WiFi/BT tools (`mac_tool.py` / `live_patch_mac.sh`) are stdlib-only and work without `pycryptodome`. All four need Python 3.6+; live patching also needs `adb` (and `fastboot` if you'd rather flash the partition image offline).

## How it works

On MediaTek MT67xx devices (verified on F21 Pro, F25, and TIQ M5), the modem firmware encrypts each IMEI in NVRAM using AES-128-ECB. The decrypted plaintext is a 32-byte block: BCD-encoded IMEI (8 bytes), a 2-byte filler at `[8:10]`, an 8-byte MD5-XOR checksum the modem validates on read, and 14 bytes of zero padding. The modem only validates the checksum — the 2-byte filler can be any value as long as the checksum is computed over it correctly. Single-SIM units (F21 Pro) populate one slot at `[0x40:0x60]`; dual-SIM units (F25, TIQ M5) populate a second at `[0x60:0x80]` with the same structure. This tool reimplements the encryption and the checksum so it can rewrite either IMEI without touching the device.

The AES key is `3f06bd14d45fa985dd027410f0214d22` — pre-computed once from MTK's standard NVRAM seed via the `SST_Get_NVRAM_SW_Key` derivation (see [bkerler/mtkclient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient) for the algorithm) and hardcoded as `AES_KEY`.

## Usage

```bash
# Read both IMEI slots (single-SIM devices show slot 2 as `(empty)`)
python3 imei_tool.py read LD0B_001
python3 imei_tool.py read nvdata.img

# Write the first IMEI (default; the only slot used by the F21 Pro)
python3 imei_tool.py write LD0B_001 350859600862948 -o LD0B_001_new

# Write the second IMEI on dual-SIM devices (F25, TIQ M5)
python3 imei_tool.py write LD0B_001 350859600862948 -s 2 -o LD0B_001_new

# Patch a full partition image
python3 imei_tool.py write nvdata.img 350859600862948 -o nvdata_patched.img
```

## File formats

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `LD0B_001` | 384-byte NVRAM IMEI file from `/mnt/vendor/nvdata/md/NVRAM/NVD_IMEI/` |
| `nvdata.img/.bin` | Full nvdata partition image (auto-detected by size > 1MB) |

The tool auto-detects whether the input is a standalone `LD0B_001` or a partition image. For partition images it scans for the `LDI` magic and patches every header-matching `LD0B_001` copy in place — live copy plus any ext4 journal/COW leftovers. Distinct copies whose 0x40-byte header differs (e.g. F25's factory backup) are skipped. No root or mounting needed.

## Live device patching

`live_patch.sh` patches a connected rooted MTK device in place: it pulls `/mnt/vendor/nvdata/md/NVRAM/NVD_IMEI/LD0B_001`, runs `imei_tool.py` to rewrite it, pushes it back, and offers to reboot. The script counts populated slots in the read output and prompts accordingly — dual-SIM gets `Change which IMEI? [1/2/n]`, single-SIM gets `Change IMEI? [y/N]`. After reboot the new IMEI is live in the radio and visible to `service call iphonesubinfo`.

### Verification status

- **F21 Pro (Android 11), live device** — end-to-end verified with random IMEIs via both paths: `live_patch.sh` (push patched `LD0B_001` back through ADB) and `fastboot flash nvdata` of a partition image patched offline by `imei_tool.py`. Slot 1 patches persisted across reboot and appeared in `iphonesubinfo`. Slot 2 reads as `(empty)` on this single-SIM device.
- **F25 (dual-SIM), firmware image only** — `imei_tool.py read`, `write -s 1`, and `write -s 2` exercised against `LD0B_001` extracted from the stock F25 firmware ZIP. Both slots decrypt cleanly with the same AES key, both produce modem-valid MD5-XOR checksums when re-encoded, and both round-trip through `encrypt → decrypt → BCD-decode`. **No F25 hardware was tested**; live-write and reboot behavior on F25 has not been confirmed.
- **TIQ M5 (dual-SIM, MT6761), live device** — `nvdata.bin` pulled via mtkclient, both slots patched offline with `imei_tool.py write -s 1` / `-s 2`, patched image flashed back via mtkclient, device booted. Both IMEIs read back as the written value on-device, confirming the modem accepts patched bytes at runtime. This is the first dual-SIM device validated end-to-end on hardware. Surfaced a bug in `_patch_all_copies` (now fixed) where same-header copies with body differences were being homogenized — see [`docs/reverse_engineering.md` § Hardware validation (TIQ M5)](docs/reverse_engineering.md#hardware-validation-tiq-m5-dual-sim). Subsequently, `./live_patch.sh` ran end-to-end on the same device: dual-SIM `[1/2/n]` prompt routed correctly, slot 1 and slot 2 each patched independently across separate runs (the other slot byte-identical post-patch), file md5 matches across reboot in both runs (modem persists). The script's pull mechanism was extended during this verification to handle a CRLF-injection observation on this device's Android 13 + Magisk combo (see the same RE doc section).

## WiFi MAC and Bluetooth address

The same NVRAM family also stores the WiFi MAC and Bluetooth address, plaintext but checksum-validated by the MTK NVRAM daemon. `mac_tool.py` (offline) and `live_patch_mac.sh` (live device) handle these the same way `imei_tool.py` / `live_patch.sh` handle IMEI.

```bash
# Offline read / write — operates on host-side files. The on-device source
# files live at /mnt/vendor/nvdata/APCFG/APRDEB/BT_Addr (440 bytes) and
# /mnt/vendor/nvdata/APCFG/APRDEB/WIFI (2050 bytes); pull them to the host
# via the binary-safe pattern in docs/live_patch.md before reading them
# locally, or pass a partition image (nvram.img / nvdata.img) directly.
python3 mac_tool.py read BT_Addr
python3 mac_tool.py read WIFI
python3 mac_tool.py read nvdata.img

python3 mac_tool.py write BT_Addr --bt   02:11:22:33:44:55 -o BT_Addr.patched
python3 mac_tool.py write WIFI    --wifi 02:11:22:33:44:66 -o WIFI.patched
python3 mac_tool.py write nvdata.img --bt   02:11:22:33:44:55 \
                                     --wifi 02:11:22:33:44:66 -o nvdata.patched.img

# Live device flow (interactive). Pulls, patches, pushes, offers reboot.
./live_patch_mac.sh
```

`live_patch_mac.sh` asks two independent prompts — `Change BT MAC? [y/N]` and `Change WiFi MAC? [y/N]` — so a single run can change BT only, WiFi only, both, or neither. If neither, the script exits without offering a reboot. The 6-byte MAC is validated client-side against `^[0-9a-f]{2}([:-][0-9a-f]{2}){5}$` (colon or dash separators).

The trailer-byte algorithm (the only non-trivial piece) was recovered by disassembling `_Z18NVM_ComputeCheckNoPKcPcb` in `/vendor/lib64/libnvram.so` on the F21 Pro: walk the file excluding the last 2 bytes, ADD on even-indexed bytes, XOR on odd-indexed bytes, store the low 8 bits as the trailer byte after a fixed `0xaa` magic. Full step-by-step trace in [`docs/wifi_bt_reverse_engineering.md`](docs/wifi_bt_reverse_engineering.md). Reference docs: [`docs/mac_tool.md`](docs/mac_tool.md) and [`docs/live_patch_mac.md`](docs/live_patch_mac.md). The stock F30 partition images used as a known-good reference came from the classic "F30 US LTE Bands Package" originally posted on XDA — F30 and F21 Pro share the MT6761 platform and the same NVRAM record layouts.

**Verification status — F21 Pro / Android 11 + Magisk only.** Two paths verified on hardware:

1. **ADB push path** (`live_patch_mac.sh`): patched APRDEB files with `02:11:22:33:44:55` (BT) / `02:11:22:33:44:66` (WiFi); both survived reboot byte-identical, `settings get secure bluetooth_address` reported the new BT MAC, BT and WiFi stacks initialized cleanly. Subsequent runs verified the BT-only, WiFi-only, and "no changes" branches of the prompt logic, and a separate run verified that BT-then-WiFi across two consecutive script invocations both persist across the same reboot.
2. **fastboot flash path** (offline `mac_tool.py write nvdata.img …`): patched a pulled `nvdata.img` with `02:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee` (BT) / `02:aa:bb:cc:dd:ff` (WiFi), `fastboot flash nvdata nvdata_patched.img`, rebooted, verified the post-flash `BT_Addr` and `WIFI` files via `mac_tool.py read` (matching what was patched) and the runtime BT MAC via `settings get secure bluetooth_address` (`02:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE`).
3. **WiFi runtime byte-level confirmation**: with `MacRandomizationSetting=0` set on the active saved network (Settings → Wi-Fi → network → Privacy → "Use device MAC", or `sed -i 's|MacRandomizationSetting" value="1"|MacRandomizationSetting" value="0"|' /data/misc/apexdata/com.android.wifi/WifiConfigStore.xml` + reboot) Android does *not* layer a random MAC on top of `wlan0`, and `cat /sys/class/net/wlan0/address` returns the chipset's permanent MAC straight from the kernel WiFi driver — i.e. the bytes the driver loaded out of the patched WIFI file. After the offline-flash test (`mac_tool.py write nvdata.img --wifi 02:0f:f1:1e:11:02 …` + `fastboot flash nvdata` + reboot + randomization-off + reboot), `cat /sys/class/net/wlan0/address` returned `02:0f:f1:1e:11:02` and `dumpsys wifi`'s `mWifiInfo MAC: 02:0f:f1:1e:11:02` agreed — byte-matching the patched WIFI file. With randomization back on (Setting=1), Android's per-SSID randomization re-asserts and `wlan0/address` shows a different random MAC per network, but the underlying chipset perm address (loaded from the patched WIFI file) is unchanged.

**Offline partition compatibility verified for F21 Pro, TIQ M5, and F25.** `mac_tool.py` recognizes BT_Addr / WIFI records on all three (the regression sweep `tests/mac_tool_edge_cases.sh` includes byte-identical full-image round-trip tests for each when the partition dumps are present in `tmp/{wifi_bt_re,tiqm5,f25}/`). F25's WIFI uses a slightly different header (`01 00 09 00` instead of `01 00 08 00`) — `mac_tool.py`'s `WIFI_HDR_VARIANTS` accepts both. See [`docs/tiq_m5_offline_analysis.md`](docs/tiq_m5_offline_analysis.md) and [`docs/f25_offline_analysis.md`](docs/f25_offline_analysis.md) for the per-device offline RE.

**Live-device verification** confirmed on **F21 Pro**, **F25**, and **TIQ M5**.

- **F21 Pro** — exercised end-to-end via this repo's `live_patch_mac.sh` and `mac_tool.py` + `fastboot flash nvdata` flows.
- **F25** — confirmed via both this repo's `live_patch_mac.sh` and an end-user running [`flipphoneguy/mtk-imei-switcheroo-app`](https://github.com/flipphoneguy/mtk-imei-switcheroo-app).
- **TIQ M5** — confirmed via an end-user running `flipphoneguy/mtk-imei-switcheroo-app`. The app's `MacCrypto.java` is a Java port of `mac_tool.py` and is empirically bit-for-bit equivalent on real partition samples (see [Related](#related)) — same `compute_checksum` algorithm, same `BT_Addr` / `WIFI` files patched. A successful patch through the app exercises the same algorithm `mac_tool.py` would.

The offline-tool side of the pipeline (`mac_tool.py read` / `write` + round-trip identity in `tests/mac_tool_edge_cases.sh`) is uniformly covered for all three.

  - **IMEI side** (against `imei_tool.py`): same AES key, slot offsets `{0x40, 0x60}`, plaintext layout, and MD5-XOR checksum.
  - **BT MAC + WiFi MAC side** (v1.0.5, against `mac_tool.py`): `MacCrypto.computeChecksum` is a direct Java port of `mac_tool.compute_checksum`. Verified equivalent on real partition samples — F21 Pro live + stock, F25, TIQ M5, F30 stock — every stored trailer byte computes the same on both implementations, and `patchBt` / `patchWifi` produce byte-identical output to `patch_bt` / `patch_wifi` for the same input. Their "supported device gate" is the trailer-checksum match itself, which transparently handles F25's `01 00 09 00` WIFI header without needing a header whitelist (because the patch path leaves the header untouched).
